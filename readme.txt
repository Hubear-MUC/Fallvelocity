FallVelocity 2.0
----------------

The FallVelocity program is one of the first simulations done within within this project of regaining and gaining knowledge in developing (scientific) software.

This version of the program got equipped with a full user interaction to enable working with it without the usage of a debugger to examine the results.

Just invoke the program.

The program calculates the speed of a body dropped down.

It asks you for the time and calculates the dropping speed the body got after this time is elapsed.

The program is written as an application, so it asks for another amount of time after every calculation.


IMPORTANT: The program can be quit by entering 0 as the time- value.


Unfortunately there was no code space left to implement a message for this on the screen.





Version history
---------------

Version 2.0

Implementation of user interaction to make this program usable without running it with a debugger.


Version 1.3

Inserted an empty line between the variable definitions and the main()- function to furthermore beautify the code and make it easier to read and maintain.


Version 1.2

Placed the opening curly bracket in a new line, also the one at the while loop, to make the code easier to read and maintain.


Version 1.1

Placed the while loop in a new line to make the code more easy to read and to maintain.


Version 1.0

Initial version
